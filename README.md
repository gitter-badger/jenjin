# jenjin

A higher level Kotlin framework built on top of libgdx. Currently only for 2D.


Jenjin aims to provide a framework which makes it as easy as possible to focus on the meaningful part of making a game with libgdx:

   * What it looks like  - rendering and effects.
   * Game logic - both the behaviour/rules of the game, and the physics of it.
   
This is still very much in developement, so apis and approaches are subject to change. More docs, tutorials/demos to follow when it is a bit more stable :D
