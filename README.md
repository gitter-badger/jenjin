# jenjin ![build-status](https://travis-ci.org/laurencegw/jenjin.svg?branch=master)

A higher level Kotlin framework built on top of libgdx. Currently only for 2D.


Jenjin aims to provide a framework which makes it as easy as possible to focus on the meaningful part of making a game with libgdx:

   * What it looks like  - rendering and effects.
   * Game logic - both the behaviour/rules of the game, and the physics of it.
   
This is still very much in development, so apis and approaches are subject to change. More docs, tutorials/demos to follow when it is a bit more stable. If you would really like to have a look though, checkout the jenjin-demo module.

Credit must also immediately be given to the work done by manuelbua [here](https://github.com/manuelbua/libgdx-contribs) for his postprocessing stuff which is included in this repo fairly unchanged. It is included inline for now so that stuff works, but will come up with a new solution shortly.

Also, if you want to actually start using this now, in its very not complete state, probably the best thing to do would be to clone it, build it and publish it to maven local. Then just include it as a dependency in your own libgdx project.
